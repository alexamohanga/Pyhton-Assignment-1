          With no command specified the program will run in a
          'shell' mode

DESCRIPTION
     The UMLDiagram package is used to parse Python code files
     and output a UML class diagram

COMMANDS
     help [command_name]
          Outputs the built in help text
          Optional paramater [command_name]: will filter and show
            only the command specified
     input file_name [file_name2] [file_name3] ...
          The input command is used to parse new Python files
          into the program for evaluation

OUTPUT FILES
     ./plantuml.txt
          The system will output a Plant UML dump before
          converting it to a PNG file in the program's working
          directory.
     ./diagram.png
          The system will generate the UML Diagram and save it as
          diagram.png in the program's working directory.

BUGS
     - Python Parsing does not support relationships
     - Methods and Attributes may be duplicated in the output
